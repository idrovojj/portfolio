                        <h5 style="color:gray">Computer Science Engineering <br> March 2019</h5>
                        <p>    Mass production is necessary for a company to be 
                        successful. As we advance further into the digital age,
                        machines are becoming more time and cost efficient when
                        mass producing. The result is a competitive environment
                        between companies to determine who has the improved means
                        of production. In an attempt to surpass their opposition,
                        the directors of the Dublin High School film, “Midterms,”
                        hired our Computer Science Engineering team to create a
                        program that would mass produce advertisements. Under our
                        client’s guidance, we became the “Midterms Manipulators”.
                        Our goal was to use a folder of raw images as input, to
                        then watermark, border, decorate, and pick a theme for
                        each image, and output a new folder of images as advertisements.
                        </p>
                        <p>One of my most important roles in the project was to 
                        search and correct errors, bugs, and exceptions in the
                        program. Some of the errors resided in image formatting,
                        image encoding, and directory filing. In order to fulfill
                        my role, I had to strengthen my logical thinking and
                        patience skills. A computer program follows very specific
                        instructions in only one particular way, which differs to
                        how a human being functions. A person follows the general
                        directions and can execute it in many different ways. I
                        needed to assimilate my thinking process to the computer’s
                        logical environment in order to find the program’s errors.
                        However, changing the way one thinks is not that simple.
                        I practiced patience when trying to understand why the
                        program did not function properly, and why my solution
                        did not fix the problem. Throughout the project there was
                        constant trial and error to figure out the bug. The most
                        important skills further developed throughout this project
                        were my logical thinking and patience skills.

                        <h3>The Storm Drain Project</h3>
                        <h5 style="color:gray">Honors Chemistry <br> October 2017</h5>
                        <p>    Water is vital. Animals, plants, and humans are 
                        dependant on it. However, it is not easy to obtain clean
                        water. Although there are storm drains and sewage systems
                        implemented in a city, it is contaminated with a variety
                        of different substances. These substances pose a threat
                        to the purity of the water. In the scenario of the project,
                        the United States Environmental
                        Protection Agency (EPA) hired our company, The Storm Drainers,
                        to investigate and identify all of the components of waste that end up
                        in the storm drain. They provided us with a 5,000 gallon
                        tanker truck filled with storm drain water mixed with its impurities. 
                        We took a small sample from the tanker, in
                        order to identify the components more easily.
                        </p>
                        <p>One of my most important roles in the project was to
                        extract the sodium chloride from the remaining liquid from
                        the sample. Extreme precision and caution were required in
                        order to achieve this, because it was crucial that no
                        substance was left behind during transfers from beaker to
                        beaker. If rushed through the procedure, it was more likely
                        to lose mass of substances, therefore lowering the obtained
                        result of sodium chloride, and increasing the percent error.
                        My methodical skills were challenged as I slowly navigated
                        through the procedure. After evaporating the water and finding
                        the mass of the sodium chloride, I was only 0.55 grams off
                        of the actual result, which means a 89 percent recovery.
                        Another role I was assigned during the project was to compile
                        all of the data from all of the other materials in the storm
                        drain sample. I was required to establish clear communication
                        with all of my colleagues in order to be able to analyze the
                        seven different masses of materials and perform percent error
                        calculations for each. The most important skills further
                        developed throughout this project were my methodical and
                        communication skills.
