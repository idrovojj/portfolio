                        <h3>Objectives, Interests, and Strengths</h3>
                            <p>Everyone has been asked the question, "What do you
                            want to be when you grow up?". Although some people
                            answer the question instantly, it has haunted me for
                            years. How are we able to decide our desired profession
                            if we have not experienced its advantages and disadvantages
                            yet? Although guest speakers from a given profession
                            provide information, it is not comparable to first-hand
                            experience. My solution to this predicament is to branch
                            out and enroll in different types of high school courses
                            in order to discover my strengths and weaknesses to a
                            given field. After three years of high school, I have
                            narrowed down my interests to statistics, chemistry,
                            and video production. However, I am currently experimenting
                            and planning to experiment with more subjects such as
                            physics, calculus, and computer engineering.
                            </p>
                            <p>Not only have the courses revealed my interests,
                            but they have additionally demonstrated and reinforced
                            my abilities. For example, my AP Statistics course
                            involved taking samples, analyzing them, and drawing
                            conclusions about the population. My communication
                            skills improved because I had to ensure information
                            was conveyed correctly between the people being sampled
                            and their results, as well as the statistics to the
                            client who requested the analysis. Furthermore, I am
                            very methodical in my studies, which has provided an
                            advantage throughout my Honors Chemistry course.
                            Nevertheless, the course still bolstered my methodicalness
                            through experimentation, calculations, and conclusions.
                            In fact, this ability allowed me to enroll in AP Chemistry
                            the following year, which contains more heavy calculations
                            and rigorous analysis. Finally, my Advanced Video Production
                            course required immense coordination between screenwriters,
                            actors, cinematographers, and film editors. Through the
                            process of overcoming all of the coordination, I gained
                            leadership. Over the succeeding year, I applied to
                            Video Production 3, which once again tested my leadership
                            skills. Since the class required longer films, the
                            production timeline increased, causing our members
                            to be dispirited. By encouraging my peers, we were
                            able to persevere and complete the project.
                            </p>
                            <p>Although I am uncertain of what profession I want
                            to specialize into, I am aware of my strengths and
                            their application to different fields of studies.
                            I can communicate information clearly and concisely,
                            execute my work with precision methodically, in addition
                            to lead and coordinate groups to a common goal. As I
                            continue to live out my high school career, I will
                            keep experimenting with different classes to discover
                            and develop more strengths. My objective is to illuminate
                            the dark path of uncertainty until I reach the final
                            decision of my career at the end. I appreciate your time,
                            and if you would like to learn more about my experience,
                            or projects, feel free to browse the rest of my website.
